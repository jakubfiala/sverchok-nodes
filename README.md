# sverchok-nodes

A collection of custom scripted nodes for the [Sverchok](https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok) Blender plugin. They may or may not work for your given use case.

**Update (22/08/2021):** the Sverchok node syntax has apparently changed so these may have to be slightly modified, see https://github.com/jakubfiala/sverchok-nodes/pull/1
